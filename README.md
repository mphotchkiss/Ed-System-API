# Ed-System-API
A node.js API server for an education technology service

## What I Learned
- Postman
- JWT token API authentication
- Sequelize
- Docker
- Producers & Consumers (RabbitMQ)
- MongoDB & File Storage

## How To Use
Assuming the repository has been cloned and docker installed and running, starting the application is simple. Just run
`
docker-compose up
`

Otherwise, the endpoints can be tested using the postman environment and collection stored in the postman directory
